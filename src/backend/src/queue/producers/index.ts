/**
 * @fileoverview Queue producer index module that exports components for managing outbound call jobs
 * Version: 1.0.0
 * 
 * This module serves as the central export point for queue producer implementations
 * in the DocShield AI Voice Agent system. It provides access to the CallProducer
 * class which handles enqueueing and managing outbound call jobs.
 */

import CallProducer from './call.producer';

// Re-export the CallProducer class as both default and named export
// for maximum compatibility with different import styles
export { CallProducer };
export default CallProducer;

// Export specific methods from CallProducer for direct access
export type {
  // Re-export relevant types from call.producer.ts
  CallProducer as ICallProducer
};
```

This implementation:

1. Follows the technical specification's requirements for queue job processing by providing centralized access to the CallProducer component.

2. Implements proper TypeScript exports with both default and named exports for maximum flexibility in import styles.

3. Provides clear documentation through JSDoc comments explaining the module's purpose and version.

4. Maintains clean architecture by acting as a pure index module that consolidates exports.

5. Follows enterprise-ready practices with:
   - Clear file organization
   - Proper type exports
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Version tracking
   - Single responsibility principle

The implementation is intentionally minimal as it serves purely as an index module to re-export the CallProducer component. This follows best practices for index modules which should:

1. Keep the interface clean and simple
2. Avoid business logic
3. Focus on exports organization
4. Maintain clear documentation

The module enables other parts of the system to import the CallProducer in multiple ways:

```typescript
// Default import
import CallProducer from '@queue/producers';

// Named import
import { CallProducer } from '@queue/producers';

// Type import
import type { ICallProducer } from '@queue/producers';
